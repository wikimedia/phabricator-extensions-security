This library contains the wikimedia customizations to phabricator security policy behavior.

Currently this involves 3 cooperating classes to secure access to maniphest tasks
that are considered either 'sensitive' or 'security bug' (as specified by the security
custom field on each task) 

  1. SecurityPolicyListener applies an initial security policy to tasks submitted with the
     'security' option set to anything other than 'none.'
     It will also reset the security policy if anyone tries to override the policy to
     'public' or 'any user' when the security flag is set to something other than 'none',
     this is just a sanity check to keep someone from inadvertantly or maliciously
     revealing a secure task without explicitly setting the security to 'none'
  2. The default security policy now includes a new custom policy rule, implemented in
     PhabricatorPolicyRuleTaskSubscribers, which allows anyone subscribed to a task
     to /view + comment/ on the task. !
  3. WMFSecurityPolicy class contains static functions related to the implementation
     of the other two, whereever it's appropriate to abstract the functionality
     intp a less workflow-specific reusable function.

  Note: The following pre-existing behavior is not changed by the new patch:
    The task author, the assignee, and any member of the corresponding 'security' project
    will be able to view/edit the task without explicitly being subscribed.

  Note 2: The custom Herald action related to security policy enforcement is now deprecated
    and it will now function as a no-op. The related herald rule should be removed from
    phabricator.
